# SquidGameProject
Lab Final that I worked on with one partner, where we both contributed to the code in the project.
The goal was to simulate the "Red Light, Green Light" game from Squid Game using Arduino and different sensors and actuators. 
We had to interface the sensors and actuators together, using an Arduino as a microcontroller, and build the entire project
onto a physical playing field. In addition, we had to import the necessary libraries and reference documentation to know how to
utilize all of the components in the lab. All in, we used an ultrasonic distance sensor, two servo motors, a green LED, a red LED,
a buzzer, a 7-segment display, a button, a battery pack, and an arduino.
